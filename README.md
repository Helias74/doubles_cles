# doubles_cles
doubles_cles is a lightweight web application that allows users to book appointments for car key duplication services in multiple locations. The site is built with React (frontend) and FastAPI (backend), and uses SQLite for local data storage. There is no payment or messaging system â€” appointment confirmations are handled via email redirects.
